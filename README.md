### Notes for Judges

All images on the normal site are <25k on disk, there are higher quality pictures when an image is clicked on in the gallery when only the specific image is requested.

The file ```flask_app.py``` is in our ```.gitignore``` because we have our api and flask-mail gmail password, and we can't use the node module ```dotenv``` since we are using flask, so we put a safe version in ```FAKE flask_app.py```

Our website is fully responsive to browser size, working on mobile devices and tables, and the pages *about* and *gallery* both changes the css grid depending on the size of the moniter, so mess around with it by changing the window size to see it respond
